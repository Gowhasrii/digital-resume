            <P>March 1, 2023 - April 30, 2023</P>
            <P> Summary: We were able to build an alcohol sensor for a car. An alcohol sensor,
                MQ3, Arduino interface cable, and GSM SIM 800L were used to achieve this.
                This alcohol sensor will determine if a person has consumed alcohol or not and,
                to a certain extent. In the event of intoxication, we will turn off the ignition of the
                vehicle and send a message to the nearest police station and family member.</P>
